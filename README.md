This project was done in accordance to the Machine Learning and Parallel Computing module in my Bachelors of Computer Science course.

I have experimented on a Kaggle Dataset by Ahsan Razat named "Used Phones & Tablets Pricing Dataset", where Machine Learning Models were used to predict the prices of second hand phones using the features of that phone.

An extensive Exploratory Data Analysis was done on the dataset to develop a cohesive understanding of the features in the dataset.
Different Preprocessing and Data Treatment techniques was also used to create multiple datasets that was transformed differently to see how they impact the performance of the machine learning models.

3 Machine Learning models was used on each dataset, which are:
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression

Optimizations were also done depending on which dataset each model performed the best on to boost performance further.

The results of the models obtained an average R2-Score of 0.85. The graphs/plots below has blue points being the actual values and the red points being the predicted values.

This project allowed me to learn a lot on the Data Analysis and Machine Learning process and the development of Machine Learning models.

Their respective results can be seen below:
