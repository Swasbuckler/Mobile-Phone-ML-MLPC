This project was done in occordance to the Machine Learning and Parallel Computing module in my Bachelors of Computer Science course.

I have experimented on a Kaggle Dataset by Ahsan Razat named "Used Phones & Tablets Pricing Dataset". 

An extensive Exploratory Data Analysis was done on the dataset to develop a cohesive understanding of the features in the dataset.
Different Preprocessing and Data Treatment techniques was also used to create multiple datasets that was transformed differently to see how they impact the performance of the machine learning models.

3 Machine Learning models was used on each dataset, which are:
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression

Optimizations were also done depending on which dataset each model performed the best on to boost performance further.

Their respective results can be seen below:
